Later he decided to name it Javascript. Brendan Eich was the founder/creator of the well-known language. "JavaScript" some of us use on a daily basis. He also designed the very first SpiderMonkey engine for the Netscape Navigator browser.

      Brendon co-founded the free and open source software project Mozilla with Jamie Zawinski after the Netscape Communications Corporation base code got transferred to the Mozilla corperation. after serving as a lead technologist in Mozilla, he got promoted to chief technical officer in 2005.
      <br>
      Brendan is also the CEO of Brave Software, an Internet browser platform company that was released in 2016 still to this current day. Not only is he the CEO but he also co-created the Basic Attention Token (BAT), a cryptocurrency designed for use in the Brave browser.
